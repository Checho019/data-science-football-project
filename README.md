## Football Match Probability Prediction
Football match outcome prediction is a challenging task with significant implications for both sports enthusiasts and the betting industry. This study addresses the problem of accurately predicting match results using machine learning techniques applied to a comprehensive dataset spanning over 150,000 historical matches. Previous research has explored various methodologies, including traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and gradient-boosted trees. In this work, we propose a solution leveraging Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks to enhance prediction accuracy. Our approach involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection based on rigorous evaluation metrics. Results indicate that while no single model achieved optimal performance, Random Forest emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 48.74%.
